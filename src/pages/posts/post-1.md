# My First Blog Post

Published on: 06-24-2025

Welcome to my Blog! This post was made as I was setting up my website. I saw Astro as a new framework and an opportunity to finally make a personal website for myself. I worked with web development a lot throughout learning software development, but I never took the time to create something for me!

## What I've accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**: I learned how to use Astro and
created a netlify account to host my website

2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: By making markdown files I can now add many posts to my blog's content!

## What's next

More blog posts!!!
